# LMSOC - Code for LMSOC

The notebook lmsoc_train_and_eval_toy_task.ipynb contains the LMSOC training code. 
It is a runnable colab notebook which demonstrates the entire process of training and evaluating LMSOC as described in the paper. If run, it will reproduce
the experimental setup for Task 1 and ultimately yield Figure 2. In order to run this notebook in colab, open this notebook in Google Colab and upload the files in "data"
directory to your colab workspace. 

P.S: This notebook assumes you have already trained social context embeddings for the data you have (for example, here the social context is time). The notebook embed_time_toy_task.ipynb
contains the implementation of how to embed time for Task 1 in the paper as an example.
